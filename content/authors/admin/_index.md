Nathan Nichols is a graduate student of [materials science](https://www.uvm.edu/materialsciencegrad)
at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu/). His research focuses on
development of high performance computational algorithms to explore the field of condensed matter
physics. Special interests include continuous space quantum Monte Carlo algorithms,
analytic continuation of imaginary-time correlation functions, exotic phases in
low dimensional systems (especially strained graphene and nanoporous environments),
and using evolutionary computation and machine learning approaches for the quantum
many-body problem. Check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/nscottnichols) and
[code.delmaestro.org](https://code.delmaestro.org/) for publicly available samples
of his code.
