abstract: The angstrom-scale coherence length describing the superfluid wave function of $^4$He at low temperatures has prevented its preparation in a truly one-dimensional geometry. Mesoporous ordered silica-based structures, such as the molecular sieve MCM-41, offer a promising avenue towards physical confinement, but the minimal pore diameters that can be chemically synthesized have proven to be too large to reach the quasi-one-dimensional limit. We present an active nano-engineering approach to this problem by preplating MCM-41 with a single, well controlled layer of Ar gas before filling the pores with helium. The structure inside the pore is investigated via experimental adsorption isotherms and neutron scattering measurements that are in agreement with large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate angstrom and Kelvin scale tunability of the effective confinement potential experienced by $^4$He atoms inside the MCM-41, with the Ar layer reducing the diameter of the confining media into a regime where a number of solid layers surround a one-dimensional quantum liquid.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Helium in quasi-one-dimensional confinement presents an excellent platform to study the emergence of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid over a broad range of interaction strengths.

A range of pressures exists where the density matches liquid $^4$He in the bulk (indicated by the shaded bar). The bottom panel shows solidification of the concentric cylindrical $^4$He layers."
