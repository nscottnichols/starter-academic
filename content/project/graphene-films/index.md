A doorway to a complicated case for wetting posed as a theoretical curiosity by
[Landau and Lifshitz](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Statistical_Physics/VzgJN-XPTRsC?hl=en) has been opened. Extension of
Dzyaloshinskii--Lifshitz--Pitaevskii (DLP) theory to include the polarization of
quasi-two-dimensional materials in a layered dielectric sandwich enables
characterization of a class of [critical wetting phenomena where film growth is
arrested](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.236802). When these materials are suspended in a geometry
where only one side is able to wet (much like a drum left in the rain), film
growth occurs to a critical finite thickness. Chemical doping, choice of
material, and even mechanical strain influence the overall wetting behavior.
Interesting research opportunities arise while studying these wetting phase
transitions. Can this wetting phenomena be modified to create surface
instabilities analogous to spinodal dewetting? Do technological implications
exist for these universal phenomena such as another route to the self-assembled
patterned surfaces or customizable ultra-thin films?
